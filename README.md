# Electro-Shopping

This is e-commerce website where people can purchase any electronics device like mobile phones, laptops, tablet and many more.

Note: I'm doing this project to understand the working of useContext() and useReducer(). Also to revisit the working of useRef and useImperative handle. I will also try to put effot to make this website responsive.

#Layout and Features, keeping the above learning/goals in the mind.
-A single page with some electronic devices arranged in grid form should be displayed on the home page. Each of the item should contain the description of the device and price and add to cart option. It should also have a cart icon displayed in which user should be able to add the cart item.
-upon clicking a item, a modal window should pop-up on top of home screen. Modal windows should contain different angle images of the same device with option to swipe across those images.
-upon adding the item, cart value should be added and item should be displayed in the cart as well.
-This page is designed only for the purpose of the revisiting and learning the above concepts and not from great visuals perspective. Efforts to make it look visually good may be put later when the primary goals of this project is kicked.

- To run this project:
  -download and open in your code editor
  -npm install
  -npm run start
